# OpenRiskNet Ontology

To support the interoperability of the OpenRiskNet an ontology is needed for semantic annotation
and representation. Currently, discussions are ongoing to see if we will fully depend on external
ontologies, e.g. on the [eNanoMapper ontology](http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/ENM)
or if a custom application ontology is needed.

This repository is an infrastructure based on that used by the eNanoMapper ontology to develop
a custom application ontology. It is alpha and may be discontinued at any moment in time.
